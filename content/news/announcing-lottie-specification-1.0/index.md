### Lottie Animation Community announces Lottie v1.0 specification

The Lottie Animation Community (LAC), a [Joint Development Foundation project](https://jointdevelopment.org/), is pleased to announce the release of the v1.0 Lottie JSON specification.
This marks a significant milestone in our efforts to establish the [Lottie File Format](https://lottie.github.io/lottie-spec/1.0/) as an open standard for efficient, scalable, and cross-platform animated vector graphics.

The v1.0 specification lays the foundation for future advancements, with a clear roadmap guiding the ongoing development of the format. We invite creators, implementers, and the wider community to explore the specification, contribute to its evolution, and help shape the future of animation technology.

For more details on the v1.0 specification and what lies ahead, visit https://lottie.github.io/changelog/.

#### About Lottie v1.0

Version 1.0 of the Lottie Animation Format is the result of the collaborative work of many Lottie stakeholders, starting with the formation of the Lottie Animation Community and its working group. The goal of v1.0 is to include all well known, commonly implemented, documentable features, to establish a foundational baseline for the format and setting the stage for future iterations. Features that are not widely supported will not be in the v1.0 specification, but implementers are encouraged to use it as a baseline and propose additions for an upcoming revision.
