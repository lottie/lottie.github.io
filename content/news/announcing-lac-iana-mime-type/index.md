The Lottie Animation Community (LAC) announces the formal assignment of ".lot" file extension and the "video/lottie+json" MIME type with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). This registration establishes a formal standard for identifying and handling Lottie animation files. 

Additionally, the Lottie Animation Community has received recognition as an authority by the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG).

The formal registration of both the ".lot" extension and the "video/lottie+json" MIME type by IANA significantly contributes to the standardization, interoperability, and overall adoption of the Lottie animation format. It allows for smoother integration and a more reliable user experience across different platforms and applications.

Recognition by the IESG acknowledges the Lottie Animation Community's efforts in developing and maintaining standards for Lottie animations. This acknowledgement reinforces the community's commitment to open and accessible animation technology.
