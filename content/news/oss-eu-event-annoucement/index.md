The Lottie Animation Community (LAC) will be presenting at Open Source Summit Europe 2025 in Amsterdam, scheduled for August 25-27, 2025.

Our session will detail the process of establishing the Lottie 1.0 specification under the Linux Foundation. We will discuss the technical challenges encountered during the standardization of the format, focusing on achieving cross-platform compatibility and consistent feature rendering.

The presentation will cover the collaborative effort involved in developing an open specification, which incorporated input from various industry stakeholders. Topics will include key components of the Lottie format, the standardization work undertaken to improve interoperability between creation tools and rendering engines, and demonstrations of the format's capabilities through practical applications. We will also provide an overview of future initiatives and invite further collaboration.

Speakers for this session include:

* **Mattia Basaglia**, Principal R&D Engineer, Lottiefiles.
* **Brandon Wilson**, Senior Software Engineer, Google.

We look forward to sharing these developments with the open-source community in Amsterdam.
